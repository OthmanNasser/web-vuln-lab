# Web Vulnerability Lab

A custom web security lab for practicing common web application attacks in a safe environment. Built using DVWA / BWAPP / custom vulnerable app on a local VM.

---

## Lab Overview

This lab is designed to simulate real-world web vulnerabilities and demonstrate how attackers can exploit them and how defenders can mitigate them.
